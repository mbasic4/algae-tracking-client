## Algae Tracking Web App

#### Objective:

An application used to monitor, observe and report algae pollution in water bodies accross USA, responsive web app built with React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

#### Key notes:

- user will always see 20 bodies of water nearest to the map center. By dragging on the map 20 water bodies nearest to the current map center will be displayed.
- map defaults to New York for biologist, and for citizen-scientist it uses his/hers location depending on their address which is geocoded
- token refreshing has not been implemented, user gets an access token which is valid for 1h
